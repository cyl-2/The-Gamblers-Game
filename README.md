-- A little about the game --
It is player-controlled, you can move the player with navigation keys.
There are two levels, easy and hard. In the hard level, the position of the player is tracked and the enemies chases after the player.
Players can create an account and log in for their scores to be stored on a leaderboard if it is high enough.
